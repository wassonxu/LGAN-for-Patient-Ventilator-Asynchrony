# LGAN-for-Patient-Ventilator-Asynchrony
We proposed a new probabilistic classification model Lock Generative Adversarial Networks (LGAN) for binary and multi-class classification problem based on Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to give precise prediction in real-time. By using the proposed LGAN framework, the space for searching GAN's architecture becomes considerably smaller and based on our evaluation criteria and statistical significance test, we can see the proposed network can achieve competitive results compared to previous study.
